# Timer
A countdown timer that can be visually understood by people without reading
or numerical skills (for example young children).  It includes an alarm
sound and has an automatic repeat feature.

I made this program for 3 year olds who have difficulty waiting for their
turn to play with a toy.  They can see how much time is left.

Uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
